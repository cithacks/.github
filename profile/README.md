# CODE OF CONDUCT 

## OUR PLEDGE
Welcome to Cit Hacks, the official tech community of camellia Institute Of Technology aimed for encouraging and promoting public speaking,communication skills, soft skills, best practices, technical expertise and opensource contribution in the field of Computer Science via conducting workshops , hackathons and mentorship sessions in an inclusive and welcoming environment

## OUR MOTO 
- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
- Don't be destructive or inflammatory.

## WHERE DOES THE CODE OF CONDUCT APPLY 

If you join in or contribute to our club ecosystem in any way, you are encouraged to follow the Code of Conduct/

Explicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to all official workshops, in-person meetings, and events including:

- The Slack & Discord channel 
- The Events, including AMAs, Gaming Nights, Zoom study call, work shops and mentorship sessions 
- The GitHub projects
- Club Meetings

## OUR VALUES 

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
   - Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).
- Be thoughtful
   - Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
   - Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
   - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
- Be charitable
   - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
   - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- Avoid destructive behavior:
   - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
   - Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
   - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
   - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
   - Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

## UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR

- Expressing or provoking:
  - Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks;
  - Biscrimination based on age, nationality, race, (dis)ability, gender (identity or expression), sexuality, religion, or similar personal characteristic;
  - Bullying or systematic harassment;
  - unwelcome sexual advances, including sexually explicit content.
- Advertisement or recruitment for events, companies, organizations, etc - unless specifically given permission by Hack Club HQ.
- Posting spam-like content that disrupts the environment of the community.
